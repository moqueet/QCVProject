		<h2>
			How long does it take to develop symptoms after you have been exposed to COVID-19?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Symptoms could appear as soon as two days after exposure or as long as 14 days later, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health shows that the median time for symptoms to show up is about five days. That is why the CDC uses the 14-day quarantine period for people with likely exposure to the new coronavirus.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What are the early symptoms of coronavirus?
		</h2>
		<p>	
			Early symptoms reported by some people include fatigue, headache, sore throat or fever. Some people experience a loss of smell or taste. Symptoms can be mild at first, and in some people, become more intense over five to seven days, with cough and shortness of breath worsening if pneumonia develops. But it is important to know that the type and severity of the first symptoms can vary widely from person to person.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Can you have COVID-19 without symptoms?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually show up from two to 14 days after exposure to the new coronavirus, but some people who are infected do not develop symptoms or feel ill.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Does ibuprofen make coronavirus symptoms worse?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The World Health Organization (WHO) is monitoring this situation, but it says at present, it does not see a reason not to use ibuprofen. WHO states, Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen. We are consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How do I know if it is COVID-19 or the flu?
		</h2>
		<p>
			It is not always easy to tell these two diseases apart without a test. Your doctor may recommend a test for the flu if you have symptoms. As of April, flu transmission has tapered off in most areas of the United States.
		</p>
		<h2>
			When should I contact a doctor about my symptoms?
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you have a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath, call 911 and tell them about your symptoms.
			Otherwise, call your doctors office and discuss your symptoms over the phone. Your doctor will discuss next steps, including whether you should have a COVID-19 test. For milder cases, your doctor will likely recommend that you rest at home and self-quarantine. If you become severely ill, you may need hospital care.
